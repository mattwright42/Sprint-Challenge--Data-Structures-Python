Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method? N/A

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function? N/A

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? This will be O(n) as it is visiting each node once.

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? This will be O(n) because the size of the queue scales with the size of the tree.

5) What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? O(n \*\* 2) from the nested loop.

6) What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? I think this is O(n) because the size of the duplicates array increases with the size of the 'names' files.

7) What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`? I think O(n) - it is running the function once?

8) What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`? O(n)
